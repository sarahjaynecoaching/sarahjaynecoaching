    Hi! I’m Sarah, and this is my story…<br>
    Two years ago, I found myself completely and utterly stuck.
    I had severe depression, anxiety, fear about my health, and
    some big life decisions that were waiting to be made. And
    guess what… I felt like I was dying inside. I felt utterly
    hopeless and alone. But… there was something I was missing.
    Something I had never even considered before. A piece of
    knowledge that would change my life forever.

    “It’s the afternoon. I feel like my breathing is getting worse.
    I’m not sure what to do. I just want to lay here and not move,
    but somehow, I’m still getting things done for my seminar, moving
    plans, and working on my coaching program. I hope God is about
    to do something really good… because I’m all out of ideas.”

        This is an excerpt from my journal from just last year.
    I was truly exhausted. In every sense of the word. I felt completely
    hopeless. Completely lost. Completely abandoned. <br><br>

    I had all these decisions to make, but it’s like I wasn’t even there
    to make them. I felt like I didn’t have a say in my life, because of
    the anxiety and fear I was experiencing. <br><br>

    During this time, I was also dealing with lots of unknown health issues.
    I had major fear and anxiety related to my body. Every morning, I would
    wake up panicking about some new sensation in my body, and going to bed
    the exact same way. The cycle just kept repeating itself day after day
    after day. I was in therapy, but I didn’t see any way out of the dark
    hole I was in. <br><br>

    At that SAME time, I was in the middle of some really big life decisions.
    One of them was the decision to move away (across the country) from my
    parents with my brother and sister. I had never done that before, and
    honestly, this seemed like the worst possible time to try it. <br><br>

    Finally, when it came time to leave, I reluctantly made the decision just
    to get in the car and start driving with my family. I can’t really describe
    the amount of fear I felt right then. Here I was, leaving everything I had
    ever known to go try something new. In the middle of physical and mental
    torture. And what was worse, is that I didn’t even feel like I could live
    without my Mom at the time. She had been my safety net. For doctor
    appointments, panic attacks, etc. But somewhere inside of me knew I wanted
    to try this. I did want something different, but I could barely see it at
    the time. <br><br>

    I remember telling my mom that the only decision I had actually made, was
    to get in the car and drive there. I told her I couldn’t see myself actually
    being able to stay. But then I got here. And I did decide to stay. For one
    week. And then another. And another. I remember one night (of many), I was
    on the phone with my mom, telling her how bad it was, and how I couldn’t do
    it. Telling her I thought it would be best to just cut my losses
    and come home. <br><br>

    The next day, my therapist asked me a question that would quite literally
    save my life. She said, “what if fear had no say in your decisions”? I
    literally couldn’t fathom that. Fear had ingrained itself into every part
    of my being. <br><br>

    After that therapy session, I thought about that a lot. I ended up making
    a decision I was really afraid to make just the next day. And then I made another. <br><br>

    I had been so afraid of doctors, I had started having panic attacks at every
    doctors’ appointment for several months before moving. I had absolutely no
    idea how to be at the doctor alone now that I was away from my mom. <br><br>

    So again… I was afraid. But that didn’t have a say in my health anymore.
    So I did the thing I had put off for so long because of fear. I got on anxiety
    medication. I started going to appointments and having medical tests I knew
    would help me have the kind of future I wanted. <br><br>

    I started being able to picture a future I actually might want. Because I knew
    that fear wasn’t who I am. And it actually had nothing to do with what I did
    or didn’t do in my life.<br><br>

    Fear wasn’t the driver anymore.<br><br>

    And let me tell you, it was HARD. It had driven every single decision I made
    for so long. And now I had to get out of bed, and say: “I feel so scared.
    Let’s go do it scared”. I remember so many times I had to do it nauseous.
    I did it anxious. I did it crying. But I did do it. Little by little.<br><br>

    I remember the feeling of not wanting to exist so vividly just last year. I
    remember not wanting to write in my journal during this time, but deciding
    to do it anyway. I’m so glad I did. And I want to thank past Sarah for that
    decision, even though she wouldn’t see the outcome at the time. Now I can
    look back and share my story with confidence because of that decision. I
    can see exactly where I came from, and where I am now. <br><br>

    I want to point out… there was NOTHING wrong with Past Sarah. She did all
    she could with what she had. And honestly, that’s exactly what we’re all doing.
    But when she was at her very lowest, she still made a decision (so many decisions)
    that I thank her for now. Even when she didn’t know how yet.<br><br>

    She really did save me. Because she stopped letting fear drive the car. She
    stopped letting it tell her to put off her health, her relationships, her
    family, her dream. Her choices. And It was completely unclear at the time. 
    I wish I could’ve seen those choices earlier sometimes.<br><br>

    Now I’m a life coaching, literally living my dream. Living the life I’ve
    always wanted… to show you it’s possible to live yours. To show you it’s
    possible to make decisions afraid. The life you want is not inaccessible.<br><br> 

    I know it’s so incredibly hard to believe. It’s hard to believe you can
    make a decision. And then step into the unknown. I get it. I really do.
    I’ve been there. But I’ve also been here. And I want to show you how to get here.<br><br>

    It’s not that I don’t feel the fear anymore. The only difference is that
    I know how to feel it now. And then how to keep moving anyway. Come keep
    moving with me. <br><br>
