    Hello, I’m Sarah. And I believe you and I are very similar.<br>
    I’m a 23-year-old girl, I’m in the middle of big life decisions, I’m figuring it all out,
    and sometimes…I feel like I’m falling apart…but not as much as I used to.<br>
    A couple years ago, I was faced with crippling fear about the future about my health, my life, etc.<br>
    I had lots of big decisions coming up, and I didn’t know how to face all of them at once.
    I felt lost and hopeless. At the same time, I had some big dreams. I had just become a certified
    life coach through The Life Coach School, and I desperately wanted to start my own business.<br>
    I thought it was impossible. I felt small, stuck, and completely incapable. But I wasn’t. I was just afraid.<br>
    Then I learned how to have anxiety, depression, etc., AND live the life I wanted to live at the same time.<br>
    At The Life Coach School, I had the honor of being trained and taught by some of the best coaches.
    That, added to my own five years of experience of actually being a young adult and making big life
    decisions, has helped me know how to meet my own clients exactly where they are and then move forward with them.<br>
    I am extremely blessed to be living this life. And I truly believe it is my dream life. Simply because
    I decide to go after the things I want! And you can too. Your own dream life is just around the corner.<br>
    Come with me, and find out for yourself.<br>
