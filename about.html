<p> INTRODUCTION PLACEHOLDER </p>

<blockquote><p>I had to do it scared.....or not at all.<br>
    I remember a day I was in therapy, just sitting there paralyzed (I barely knew
    why I was even going at this point). And then my therapist said something that
    was about to change my life. She said, "what if you decided that fear has no say
    in your decisions?" My brain couldn't comprehend that. Fear was ingrained into 
    every single thing I thought or did. How could she even be asking me to consider that? 
    Then I remember a day I was just sobbing on my bed. So many question were running 
    through my head. How could I let this happen to my life? Is there a place for a 
    "person like me" in this world? How can my Heavenly Father still love me, and be 
    so cruel at the same time? I didn't want to exist. That moment, I realized fear had
    entered every part of my life. And I was letting it decide everything for me. 
    Fear wasn't the problem though. So I made a decision. Fear wasn't the driver anymore.
    And I wish I could say I knew how I did it. But I just did it. I did everything afraid.
    I did it nauseous. I did it terrified. I did it paralyzed. I did it. I just started.
    I started going to the doctor more. I started doing the tests that would help my
    doctors figure out what's wrong. And every time.... Every. Single. Time....I was
    terrified. AND I knew what I wanted my life to look like. I wanted something else.
    So I felt fear. And then I took one step. And then I felt it again.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>"Future Sarah,<br>I'm not even sure what to say right now. I know
    you're having to do and go through the hardest things you've ever
    faced right now. I wish I could say you're strong, and I know you
    can make it. But honestly, I don't think I can right now. Because
    I don't feel sure......you've always dreamed of the things you're
    so unsure of now." This was written in my journal at a time where
    all I could think about was my health. I was losing my hair,
    feeling out of breath almost every second of every day, barely
    eating. Having panic attacks at ever doctor appointment. In a 
    sense, I was completely paralyzed. I was consumed by fear and
    anxiety. I thought my future was completely empty. I remember
    crying on the bathroom floor, absolutely begging for my Heavenly
    Father. Begging him to just come back to me. I want these posts
    to have moments of hope throughout, and not just at the end, because
    they do. But I couldn't see it at the time. During those moments
    though, I can look back and see myself making tiny decisions. Like
    the decision to pray, even though at the time, it felt like it was
    just to yell at God. Even if I didn't think He was there. Looking
    back, that tiny decision to pray, angrily, kept my relationship
    with Him alive. And then I kept making more decisions.....

<p> INTERMISSION PLACEHOLDER </p>

<blockquote><p>When I started grieving, I started healing.âœ¨ I remember the moment
    I accepted the fact that things were not how I wanted them to be.
    And that it was ok that I was grieving what I had imagined my life
    would look like during this time. It just didn't look like that
    anymore. I had to grieve. And that's ok. It was necessary. I was
    letting myself be healed. In this new life. In the life I was
    living RIGHT THEN. I stopped waiting for a life I had imagined
    in my head. And there was SO. Much. Grief. And SO. Much. Hope. 
    It was scary. It was like a whole new world had opened up to me.
    And it was different, and more difficult, than I ever thought possible.
    But I stopped longing for the life I had wanted, and started living
    in the real thing. I started dreaming in my REAL life. In this life
    full of depression, anxiety, grief......and let me tell you something.
    It wasn't sad. It was magical. Because it was real. It was my life.
    And I started living it again. The more I tell my story, the more I
    realize just how human I am. Just how human you are. We all are. 
    The way you get to know yourself when you're doing something you never
    thought you could do, is so deep. It's so intimate. I am so much more
    brave than I thought I was. Being brave is just taking one step in a
    direction you're afraid (and excited) to go. What would happen if you
    started talking about how brave you are, instead of how scared you
    are? Because you are. Maybe you've just been deciding to talk about
    the scary part instead of the brave part. That's what I was doing.
    Until I just took one step. For me right now, that step is sharing my story.
